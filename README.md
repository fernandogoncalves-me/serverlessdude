Are you a **Python developer** interested in learning how to build **serverless apps on AWS**? ⚡️🐍

Are you confused and not knowing where to start? 🤷🏻

I know how it feels… 👇

When I built my first serverless app on AWS in 2016 I STRUGGLED to:

❓Define which AWS services were the best fit for my solution

❓Create a development environment that helped me be productive

❓Troubleshoot issues when my application didn’t work as expected

I was coming from a world where applications would always run on servers that I had full control over… this was not the case at all for these cloud native apps and that made a world of difference.

However, I made a decision to go ALL IN on serverless and in less than 1 year, awesome job opportunities started to show up for me. 🚀

Now, after 4+ years building real-world serverless applications and having multiple AWS certifications, I want to help you get those same awesome opportunities.
